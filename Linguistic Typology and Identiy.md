So I have two angles to approach this from - linguistic typology on human predicate statement strategies, and what I'll cal "Naive mathematical epistemology." I'll leave "haven't y'all *read* Wittgenstein, 'identity' is clearly a cluster concept!" to someone who's actually read Wittgenstein. 

Some book-keeping : linguistics generally uses a much broader definition of "Predicate" that philosophy, normally to denote the not-subject part of a sentence; I will try to denote if I'm using the fuzzy Linguistics Predicate or the Philosophical Predicate, as distinct from Philosophical Identity statements.

So, the fun secret of languages is they don't need to have anything but normal verbs and nouns, and can generally expressive everything with them - and explicitly without anything approximating "A copula" as it it used in this discussion. With that in mind, _how on earth do you do copula-y things then?_

In a bunch of ways!

In general, linguistic typologists talk about 4 or so Ling!Predicates that fit in with copula situations, which all may be using distinct strategies or even distinct copulas: 
- Nominal "X is <Noun>"
- Adjectival "X is <Adjective>"
- Possessive "X has/owns <Thing>" / "X is Y's"
- Locational "X is at/by/with/etc <Place>"

Nominal Ling!Predicates are probably the most cogent for the discussion, in that they can be used for both Phil!Predicative "Sarah is a girl" and Phil!Identity "Sarah is not David", "That star is Alpha Centauri". If you speak Arabic or Russian, you're probably familiar with the 'null copula', where English 'X is Y' sentences literally as "X Y" sentences. In both languages, a genuine copula is normally used in the past, but there are examples of languages where copulas are _never used for these situations._ [^1]

Sometimes, languages have two or more distinct copula-like constructions like Spanish _ser, estar_ and Hindi _he/ho/huun, honaa_ that differ in form being a 'Temporary' or 'Permanent' state, the latter of which naturally lends itself more to Phil!Identity comments, even though it allows both forms. Sometimes, more normal verbs also allow for complex comment on the object, like Arabic's _SabaaH_ for the subject becoming something. 

Adjectival Ling!Predicates probably fit more naturally into phil!predicates because they normally express some state an entity is in like "Sara is tall", which sometimes can be used to modify nouns "A tall boy". Since some languages just flat out don't have adjectives or even severely limits their use [^2], their are a few ways to handle this - adjectives as noun-y things or verb-y things. In verb-y Qafar or Navajo, saying "X is tall" is lit. "X talls" - and in Navajo "a tall boy" would be "a boy who talls" utilizing relative clauses. In more noun-y Maori, "The talk is good" is lit "a good the talk" [^3], and similarly in Hausa "The boy is tall" lit "the boy tall-one is" [4]. Interestingly, Hausa requires a copula-esq construction for regular adjectives: "The tall boy" lit "the boy [who tall one is]".

An interesting note is that some languages utilize both verb-y and more normal adjectival ling!predicate stuff, with the former used for temporary/permanent _Ser/Estar_ as well. [^3], and it doesn't appear that there's any correlation between zero-copula stuff and distinct verbal Ling!Predicates, as well, which means some languages may lean into having stronger distinctions. [^5]

Locational Ling!Predicate is also interesting for how it _can_ starkly contrast itself from the nominal predication above, suggesting speakers have some strong sense of the distinction. This distinction can either be something like the permanent/temporary _Ser/Estar_ stuff from above, or even having a unique copula purely for locational statements (!!!) [^6], suggesting again a clear possible distinction between potential Identity statements and phil!Predicative statements. 

Possessive Ling!Predicates are pretty interesting, but I feel they are a bit orthogonal to this discussion and hence I'll leave off a citation and note that they have some _fascinating_ semantics bundled in, particularly existence. [^7]

So to end this small paper - languages have a pretty diverse way of making phil!predicative and phil!identicative sentences, and oftentimes cordon off particular categories of semantics with wildly distinct strategies and constructions, usually with some strongly bundled semantics of their own. I've done no research on the mental linguistics aspects of it, but I discovered there's been a recent paper on the topic that makes a strong _No_. [^8]

Haven't had the chance to research this in detail, just letting you know.

    Note verbs and apparently ling!predicates tend to be clustered at the start
